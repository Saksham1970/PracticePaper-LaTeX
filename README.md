# PracticePaper LaTeX
Srapes Questions off of [practicepaper.in](https://practicepaper.in) and converts them into Latex (and PDFs) for physical copies.

# How To Use

- Put the URL and the topic name in Scrapper.py and run the file
- It will create a folder with the topic name and JSON file in it with all the details of Questions and Answers
- Put the same topic name in Latexer.py and set skip_images to False (or True if it failed after downloading images or you changed something and want to build latex without downloading images), set pdflatex to True if you have it and also want to convert to PDF.
- Done!
